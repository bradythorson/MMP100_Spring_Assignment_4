      <h1>You did not wear a hat</h1>
    <p>You may be questioning your luck as you decided to not wear a hat but you ended up getting rained on. Your hair and head are very wet but at least you made it to class on time! Now you have a full day ahead of you and you feel prepared to take it on.
      Have a good day!</p>
