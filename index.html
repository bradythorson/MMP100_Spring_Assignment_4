      <h1>Waking up in the Morning</h1>
    <p>You wake up to your alarm. You read the clock and realize you have 90 minutes till you have to be at school. You don't want to oversleep and be late for class, but you really feel you could grab just another 15 minutes of sleep. 
        What do you do?</p>
