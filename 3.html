      <h1>You risked it for a little more sleep</h1>
    <p>You wake back up, you look upat your alarm clock, and your eyes widen with dread. Your class starts in 10 minutes. Even if you got up and took the most direct route to class it would still take you an hour to get there and it would be well over halfway over. You decide it isn't worth it. Your cat seems to agree, curled up next to you asleep.</p>
